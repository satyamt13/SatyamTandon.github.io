# NLP and Recommender Systems with Amazon Movies & TV Reviews
## Short Summary 
* Mined, visualized and pre-processed 650,000 observations of movie reviews using tokenizing, stemming and lemmatizing to build a multi - class classification Naive Bayes Model with 4 different combinations of word embeddings to predict rating given just the review text.
* Used local surrogates model using the LIME( local interpretable model agnostic explanations ) library to explain individual predictions.
* Using LDA topic modeling to build a theme - based recommender system and SVD to build a model based collaborative filtering recommender system.

# Analysis of Pronto, a bicycle share system in Seattle, WA
## Short Summary
* Merged and wrangled data to drive insights, segment and visualize Pronto's customer base. Computed p-values to validate correlation coefficients.
* Pre-processed, extracted and engineered features for ML models. Used ensemble methods like XGBoost Classifier and XGBoost regressor to predict destination of riders once a bike had been checked out and the number of possible transactions in a given day using various weather features.
* Set up cloud computing to use XGB library on Amazon EC2 instance due to the large amount of training vectors available to train the ML models.
