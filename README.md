# NLP and Recommender Systems with Amazon Movies & TV Reviews
## Short Summary 
* Mined, visualized and pre-processed 650,000 observations of movie reviews using tokenizing, stemming and lemmatizing to build a multi - class classification Naive Bayes Model with 4 different combinations of word embeddings to predict rating given just the review text.
* Used local surrogates model using the LIME( local interpretable model agnostic explanations ) library to explain individual predictions.
* Using LDA topic modeling to build a theme - based recommender system and SVD to build a model based collaborative filtering recommender system.
