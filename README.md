# NLP and Recommender Systems with Amazon Movies & TV Reviews
## Short Summary 
* Mined, visualized and pre-processed 650,000 observations of movie reviews using tokenizing, stemming and lemmatizing to build a multi - class classification Naive Bayes Model with 4 different combinations of word embeddings to predict rating given just the review text.
* Used local surrogates model using the LIME( local interpretable model agnostic explanations ) library to explain individual predictions.
* Using LDA topic modeling to build a theme - based recommender system and SVD to build a model based collaborative filtering recommender system.

# Analysis of Pronto, a bicycle share system in Seattle, WA
## Short Summary
* Merged and wrangled data to drive insights, segment and visualize Pronto's customer base. Computed p-values to validate correlation coefficients.
* Pre-processed, extracted and engineered features for ML models. Used ensemble methods like XGBoost Classifier and XGBoost regressor to predict destination of riders once a bike had been checked out and the number of possible transactions in a given day using various weather features.
* Set up cloud computing to use XGB library on Amazon EC2 instance due to the large amount of training vectors available to train the ML models.

# Data Science Industry Challenge: EDA, time-series data, experiments and metrics design, machine learning
## Short Summary 
* Removed noise and visualized trends in time series data for customer logins for ultimate ride hailing service. Zeroed in on data to visualize aggregate trends by weekday and hour identifying peak and slow times.
* Theorized A/B testing experiment and metrics design to ascertain wether reimbursing drivers for toll costs would incentivize them to take fares across neighboring cities during times of high demands.
* Cleaned and imputed missing data , pre-processed data and engineered new features from the data to get it ready for machine learning models to be able predict customer churn. Trained and Validated models.

# Data Science Industry Challenge, Relaxo inc: Feature Engineering, Machine Learning
## Short Summary 
* Identified and constructed the target variable from two separate datasets manipulating categorical and date time object data. Trained , validated and tested a random forest classifier on the data to be able to predict customer churn.
* Intuitively engineered three additional features from given data which proved paramount in achieving an extremely high overall accuracy(98.07%) , high precision(98.3%) and high recall(96.8%) on the unseen/hold out set.
